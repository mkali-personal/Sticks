00:00:35,974 --> 00:00:37,402
Welcome. What is the name?

15
00:00:37,462 --> 00:00:38,771
Sufgi (sounds like doughnut)

16
00:00:38,990 --> 00:00:40,517
Nice to meat you, I am Moshik

17
00:00:40,557 --> 00:00:41,386
Welcome to the stomach

18
00:00:41,466 --> 00:00:43,085
Your first checkpoint on your road

19
00:00:43,117 --> 00:00:45,228
Where, are you headed, if I may ask?

20
00:00:45,371 --> 00:00:46,339
Going to the butt

21
00:00:46,355 --> 00:00:47,355
Ok, Ok

22
00:00:47,561 --> 00:00:48,910
Because of any special reason?

23
00:00:49,212 --> 00:00:51,132
Did you hear that it is nice over there?

24
00:00:51,180 --> 00:00:53,307
I (don't) know... My family is there - Yes...

25
00:00:53,355 --> 00:00:54,974
My friends are there, Going to the butt

26
00:00:55,038 --> 00:00:55,878
Yes...

27
00:00:55,974 --> 00:00:57,783
Can I just have a moment of your time, before?

28
00:00:59,101 --> 00:01:00,541
Yalla, nu, quickly

29
00:01:00,656 --> 00:01:02,590
So, as I mention, I am Moshik

30
00:01:02,673 --> 00:01:04,259
Generally speaking, I am the Enzyme in charge here

31
00:01:04,328 --> 00:01:06,008
On the metabolism topic

32
00:01:06,058 --> 00:01:07,450
did you hear about metabolism already?

33
00:01:07,450 --> 00:01:08,669
Do you know the term?

34
00:01:08,693 --> 00:01:09,708
Familiar (with it), yes

35
00:01:09,788 --> 00:01:10,908
Not, not a pro

36
00:01:11,011 --> 00:01:13,058
Metabolism means something very simple

37
00:01:13,185 --> 00:01:15,153
Every material that enters the body, breaks down

38
00:01:15,312 --> 00:01:17,613
Absorbed in the body, and helps the different systems

39
00:01:17,661 --> 00:01:18,201
Ok

40
00:01:18,391 --> 00:01:20,359
Vegtables and fruits are giving us vitamines

41
00:01:20,518 --> 00:01:22,375
Proteins help us building the muscles

42
00:01:22,534 --> 00:01:23,804
Complex carbonshydrates are giving us

43
00:01:23,979 --> 00:01:25,994
Available energy for the daily activity

44
00:01:26,011 --> 00:01:28,545
And once in a while, arriving to the body,

45
00:01:28,625 --> 00:01:30,343
the so called "empty" carbonhydrates

46
00:01:30,423 --> 00:01:32,026
with plenty of saturated fat

47
00:01:32,153 --> 00:01:34,724
Who tend to break down more, and even accumulate

48
00:01:34,836 --> 00:01:37,138
in places like the belly, the thighs

49
00:01:37,217 --> 00:01:40,502
The butt. - yes, also... also the posterior

50
00:01:40,614 --> 00:01:43,328
Now, towards the holiday, we started here with a new initiative

51
00:01:43,450 --> 00:01:45,497
Everyone breaks down - everyone contributes

52
00:01:45,561 --> 00:01:48,021
From now pn - also simpler carbonhydrates will break down,

53
00:01:48,100 --> 00:01:49,846
Will give available energy to the body

54
00:01:49,942 --> 00:01:52,577
and this way, we will keep a more esthetic enviorment

55
00:01:52,577 --> 00:01:56,353
a healthier enviorment, that is fun to live in to all of us

56
00:01:57,688 --> 00:01:59,307
I am going to the butt, I don't get it

57
00:01:59,332 --> 00:02:00,894
But, did you understand our initiative?

58
00:02:00,894 --> 00:02:02,021
Did you understand the importance?

59
00:02:02,228 --> 00:02:03,212
