00:00:02,07 --> 00:00:02,710

00:00:03,730 --> 00:00:04,830

3
00:00:05,030 --> 00:00:06,870

4
00:00:07,000 --> 00:00:08,020

5
00:00:16,940 --> 00:00:18,100

6
00:00:20,740 --> 00:00:21,340

7
00:00:21,440 --> 00:00:22,140
What? - ok,

8
00:00:22,140 --> 00:00:23,240
I am arriving late today

9
00:00:23,240 --> 00:00:25,340
so the showers and everything - you are doing on your own

10
00:00:25,480 --> 00:00:26,140
Will you manage?

11
00:00:26,640 --> 00:00:26,940
Bye

12
00:00:26,941 --> 00:00:26,941
Roi?

13
00:00:26,990 --> 00:00:27,410

14
00:00:29,290 --> 00:00:30,590
If mommy is not at home

15
00:00:30,990 --> 00:00:32,290
Ra pa pa pa

16
00:00:33,090 --> 00:00:34,290
I am shitting

17
00:00:34,290 --> 00:00:35,690
With an opened door

18
00:00:36,600 --> 00:00:38,400
Oh my baby

19
00:00:38,400 --> 00:00:39,400
Don't stress me out

20
00:00:40,100 --> 00:00:41,000
Give (me) a second

21
00:00:41,000 --> 00:00:42,900
to enjoy from the juice

22
00:00:43,700 --> 00:00:44,700
Resist!

23
00:00:45,400 --> 00:00:46,600
I resist!

24
00:00:46,600 --> 00:00:48,100
To orange juice

25
00:00:48,100 --> 00:00:49,000
With (fruit) pieces

26
00:00:50,600 --> 00:00:52,800
Come on - I didn't come to eat

27
00:00:54,800 --> 00:00:56,300
(I) only want to drink

28
00:00:59,100 --> 00:01:00,700
If mommy is not at home

29
00:01:01,100 --> 00:01:02,000
Ra pa pa pa

30
00:01:03,200 --> 00:01:04,800
I build a camp

31
00:01:04,800 --> 00:01:05,800
In the sofa

32
00:01:06,500 --> 00:01:09,700
Again you fell asleep intead of watching out

33
00:01:10,700 --> 00:01:12,900
The enemy is attacking here for an hour already

34
00:01:13,700 --> 00:01:14,600
Resist!

35
00:01:15,400 --> 00:01:16,600
I Resist!

36
00:01:16,600 --> 00:01:18,000

37
00:01:18,000 --> 00:01:19,000
With (fruit) pieces

38
00:01:20,600 --> 00:01:22,800

39
00:01:24,900 --> 00:01:26,300
(I) Only want to drink!

40
00:01:29,500 --> 00:01:30,700
Going crazy

41
00:01:31,300 --> 00:01:33,000
(I) Don't know

42
00:01:33,000 --> 00:01:35,300
How to "swallow" the hit (the pain)

43
00:01:36,300 --> 00:01:37,900
It is not pleasant to me

44
00:01:38,400 --> 00:01:39,700
It *is* tasty to me

45
00:01:40,100 --> 00:01:42,300
Who is doing "a jackpot" on me (earning on my expanse)

46
00:01:42,600 --> 00:01:43,000
I...

47
00:01:43,700 --> 00:01:44,600
Resist

48
00:01:45,400 --> 00:01:46,400
"How" resist (Resist so much)

49
00:01:46,400 --> 00:01:48,000
To orange juice

50
00:01:48,000 --> 00:01:49,000
With (fruit) pieces

51
00:01:50,600 --> 00:01:52,800
Come on, I didn't come to eat

52
00:01:54,900 --> 00:01:56,600
Only want to drink
